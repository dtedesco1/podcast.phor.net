This week we review the Area NFT smart contract, discuss the Tesla Model T, and how to find all your tokens on OpenSea for a collection and transfer them at the lowest cost with nft.life. We also discuss how to set up Mocha for list testing your code, and hacking Twitch to let you link to a video recording before it's published. We also discuss guidelines for Hardhat.
